//! Every write the CLI makes, and the four macros the commands write through.
//!
//! The macros are `#[macro_export]`ed because `src/main.rs` is a separate crate
//! from the library and also prints through them. So they live at the crate
//! root: `use crate::outln;` inside the library, `postmark_cli::errln` outside.

/// Writes to stdout, with a closed pipe treated as the end of the run.
///
/// `println!` panics when the write fails, and a reader that quits early
/// (`postmark-cli outbound search --all --format jsonl | head`) closes the pipe
/// under the writer. Rust ignores `SIGPIPE`, so that write comes back as
/// `ErrorKind::BrokenPipe` rather than killing the process, and restoring the
/// default handler needs `libc` and an `unsafe` block the crate forbids. So the
/// output goes through here instead: a closed pipe ends the output quietly and
/// leaves the exit code alone.
///
/// Returns `false` when stdout is closed, so that `--all` stops fetching pages
/// nobody will read (decision 9).
